  Our <a href="/docs/caextract.html">CA extract</a> service is very popular to
  download Mozilla's CA cert bundle in PEM format. Starting now, we also
  provide a proper HTTPS download link for users who want to be sure there's
  no foul play going on during the download.

<p>
  The HTTPS download is provided via github so it will also provide an
  alternative hosting site for cases where one or the other has
  problems. Since there's a chicken-and-egg problem with TLS and CA certs, we
  still offer the same download URL as before over plain HTTP as well.

Summer of Code</a> on the behalf of the curl project, to have us participate
as a mentoring organization 2008.
<p>
To get good results from Google's Summer of Code, we need a fair amount of
volunteering mentors and we need a good set of interesting projects to make
students get attracted.
<p>
Check the current list of ideas and mentors <a href="/docs/gsoc2008.html">here</a>.

 NSUBJ(Help out autobuilding curl on multiple platforms!)
 NDATE(21 Jan 2003)
 NCOLS
<p>
I've spent some time on putting together a shell script that I would like
people to run on various operating systems. The script testcurl does:
<ol>
 <li> updates curl source from CVS
 <li> generates the build environment (using buildconf)
 <li> runs configure (optionally using your custom arguments)
 <li> builds curl (in a separate build-dir)
 <li> runs the tests (make test)
 <li> removes the build dir
</ol>
<p>
The output from all this should be mailed to the automatic receiver I've
setup for this purpose.
<p>
Personally, I'll setup and run this script on a Solaris 2.7 host and at least
one Linux i386. I'll make sure that these run regularly.
<p>
So, if you have some CPU cycles to spare and some time to set things up,
please get in touch and help us out.
<p>
The collected status of all distributed tests that are collected will of
course be viewable on the curl web site, and I'm smoothing out the scripts
for it right now.

   href="http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/286290/2002-07-31/2002-08-06/0">IE
   security advisory</a> regarding how IE doesn't properly verify SSL
   certificates.
 <p>
   This has been discussed in curl mailing lists regarding how curl behaves on
   similar situations and to make this clear here and now: <b>curl does no
   peer certificate checks <i>at all</i> unless specifically told to</b>.
 <p>
   This means that man-in-the-middle attacks can easily be performed on
   servers that you curl to, unless you tell curl to verify the certificate
   with a CA.
 <p>
   This is how the SSL and certificates have been implemented in curl, on
   purpose. This is not a flaw. We might have reasons to reconsider how the
   documentation on this matter should be spelled out and properly displayed,
   and we might even change the future behavior somewhat.
 <p>
   Of course we need your input on what to do and what not to do.

  <li> Read the <a href="//curl.se/q/analysis.html">questionnaire
       Analysis</a>! If you're the least interested in this project, I think
       you're obliged to read the analysis to see what we all think about the
       current situation and about the future. It is quite lengthy as I did
       put some effort into this.
  <li> Help us get the new <a

       server</a> compile and run all over.

 NSUBJ(curl Pages to Check Out)
 NDATE(25 January 2002)
 NCOLS

 <p>
  The fact that there's a company named Curl is not news to us. We've
  summarized <a href="/docs/thename.html">the name issue</a> on a web page
  for everyone who want to find out how we ended up like this and if we really
  are targeted for legal problems due to this...
 <p>
  freshmeat.net is the number one site that new curl releases are announced
  on. It allows users to rate single projects, and I'd like more people to <a
  href="http://freshmeat.net/rate/1612/">rate curl</a>. Use your heart, is it
  good or is it bad?
 <p>
  Some companies offer curl support and/or host web sites for you with curl
  enabled and available. We intend to collect these companies in the <a
  href="/support.html">support</a> section. If you run a company that would
  match but is missing, we want to know!
